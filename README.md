## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Christopher Jordan. I am currently a senior in aerospace engineering. I am interested primarily in the propulsion of rockets. However, I enjoy most aspects that go into studying aerospace engineering. When I graduate, my plan is to become and air force pilot, and years later, an airline pilot.
### What I'm interested in for this class
I am very interested in learning how to effectively and efficiently use github, and all other programs we will use for the class. I am not very familiar with any of the programs, so I am looking forward to the challenges that this class will bring.
### Hobbies
Some of my hobbies include golf, fishing, hiking, and camping. I am also a very big fan of baseball. Go Cubs!
